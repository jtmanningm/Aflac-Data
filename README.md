Economic Data Analysis: Comparing Wage Growth and Childcare Costs
This project pulls economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Series: LEU0252881500) and the Federal Reserve Economic data (Series: CUSR0000SEEB) to compare wage growth over the past 10 years to rising childcare costs over the last 10 years. The goal of this project is to identify any correlation between the two economic indicators and provide insights for policy makers and individuals.

## Data Sources ##

Bureau of Labor Statistics (Series: LEU0252881500) - This dataset contains information on the average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls by industry.
Federal Reserve Economic data (Series: CUSR0000SEEB) - This dataset contains information on the average weekly childcare costs for children under the age of 5.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation ##

The data from both sources will be cleaned and prepared to ensure that they are in a format suitable for analysis. This will involve cleaning missing or incorrect data, and ensuring that the data is in a consistent format.

## Analysis ##

The data will be analyzed to identify any correlation between wage growth and rising childcare costs over the past 10 years.
Visualizations will be created to help illustrate the findings of the analysis.

## Results ##

The results of the analysis will be presented in the form of a report or presentation, with insights and recommendations for policy makers and individuals.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
