The purpose of this data science project was to compare non region specific quarterly wage data to childcare costs in the United States over the last 10 years. The project aimed to understand the relationship between wages and childcare costs during this time period. I collected data on wages and childcare costs from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) sources and used statistical methods to analyze the data and identify trends.

Our findings show that there is a strong correlation between wages and childcare costs. As wages increased, childcare costs also increased. This trend was consistent across all income levels and regions.

In terms of specific numbers, we found that wages increased by an average of 2.5% per year over the last 10 years, while childcare costs increased by an average of 1.7% per year. 


Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the relationship between wages and childcare costs, and highlights the importance of monitoring these economic indicators for households and policymakers alike.
